The COMBINI project aims to advance our understanding of complementary medicine (CM) approaches through the development of novel informatics methods and resources. This research is supported by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) of the National Institutes of Health.

## Project Overview

Complementary medicine approaches are increasingly used in healthcare, but evidence about their effectiveness, safety, and biological mechanisms remains scattered across various sources. COMB addresses these challenges by:

1. Creating comprehensive ontologies of CM interventions and mechanisms
2. Developing NLP methods to extract knowledge from biomedical literature
3. Building an integrative knowledge graph from literature and databases
4. Supporting evidence-based integration with conventional medicine

## Research Impact

This work will advance our ability to:

- Access reliable evidence on CM approaches
- Understand biological mechanisms of CM interventions
- Support evidence-based clinical decision making
- Enable new scientific discoveries
- Improve integration of CM with conventional medicine

## Funding
