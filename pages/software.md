## Knowledge-Enhanced NLP Tools

Our project develops open-source software tools that combine biomedical knowledge with neural architectures for clinical NLP tasks. All tools are freely available for research purposes.

### Current Tools

No tools yet! Check back soon for updates.

### Planned Releases

We are developing several other tools that will be released throughout the project:

#### COMB-KG
A comprehensive knowledge graph for complementary medicine (CM) that integrates:
- Ontological information (COMBO)
- Literature-mined semantic relations with rigor indicators
- Publication metadata
- Information from public CM-relevant knowledge bases
- **Features**: neo4j graph database, API access, visual graph browser
- **Status**: In development

#### KG-Hub Integration Tools
Tools for generating and managing FAIR-compliant knowledge graphs:
- Knowledge graph construction utilities
- Graph machine learning algorithms
- KG embedding generators (supporting translational, semantic matching, and GNN models)
- **Status**: Planned

#### SemMedKG-COMB
An integrated knowledge graph combining COMB-KG with SemMedDB:
- Filtered relationships with accuracy classifiers
- Confidence scoring for NLP-generated relationships
- Multiple versions for different use cases
- **Status**: Planned

## Using Our Software

All software will be released under open-source licenses and will include:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Usage examples
- Pre-trained models where applicable
- Installation instructions

Check back regularly for updates as we release our tools.
